Hi! 

I am a ridiculous rose and I will tell you what I like and what I don't like.

I don't like to wrestle, I don‘t like to carry things and I don’t like to wrench.

What I like is writing.

But I don‘t have much space so I guess this is the end. 

No no no it is to early to be the end so I am going to tell you a story about a egg.

Once upon a time there was a egg called john. 

John was a egg. 

Was he a pencil?

No no no he is a egg.

Ok. we already know he is a egg.

THIS is the story. 

John went to get some bread but when he went out there was a dragon.

So the dragon ate him and john died. 

No no no it is to early for him to die so john got a block of bread and smacked the dragon in the face! 

After he went home happily.
